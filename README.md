# GPU_Pathtracer
A project I did in my free time to test GPU vs CPU speedup

Requires DX12.

The project is a simple GPU pathtracer based on Peter Shirley's book Ray Tracing: In One Weekend. I used the braynzarsoft tutorials on DX12 as a template for the DX12 code and modified it in order to send the necessary data to the GPU.
The shader is basically a simplified version of the C++ code of Shirley's book, with a few modifications in order to make it run on the GPU.
